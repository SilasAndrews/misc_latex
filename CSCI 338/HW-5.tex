%When writing up your solution, comment out the following until you reach Problem 1.
\noindent
This assignment is due on {\bf Tuesday, April 13, 8:00pm}. It is strongly
encouraged that you use Latex to generate a single pdf file and upload it
under {\em Assignment 5} on D2L. But there will NOT be a penalty for not
using Latex (to finish the assignment). This is {\bf not} a group-assignment,
so you must finish the assignment by yourself.

\section*{Problem 1}

\noindent
We are given 5 matrices $M_1,...,M_5$, their dimensions (i.e., rows by columns)
are as follows: 
$M_1$ is 15 $\times$ 20,
$M_2$ is 20 $\times$ 30,
$M_3$ is 30 $\times$ 10,
$M_4$ is 10 $\times$ 50, and
$M_5$ is 50 $\times$ 8.
\newline

\noindent
(1.1) Run the dynamic programming algorithm for {\em matrix chain multiplication} that we covered in class to produce the table $m[-,-]$.
\newline

\noindent
(1.2) What is the optimal solution value? Where do you find it? 
\newline
\newpage

\section*{Problem 2}

\noindent
We are given a context-free grammar $G$ as follows:
\newline

$G$: $S\rightarrow AS|SB$

~~~  $A\rightarrow AD|DA|a$

~~~  $B\rightarrow BB|BD|b$

~~~  $D\rightarrow DD|d$.

We are also given a string $w=bdbdd$.
\newline

\noindent
(2.1) Run the dynamic programming algorithm for $A_{CFG}$ that we covered in class to produce the table $table[-,-]$.
\newline

\noindent
(2.2) How do we know whether $G$ generates $w$ from the table?
\newline
\newpage


\section*{Problem 3}

Show that $ALL_{DFA}\in$ P.

\section*{Problem 4}

Show that Independent Set $\in$ NP.
